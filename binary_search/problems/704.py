# 704. Binary Search | Leetcode.com

# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order,
# and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. 
# If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
